    Update the client's KYC information after collecting updated values from the user.

    CRITICAL: Only call this tool AFTER you have collected the updated values from the user!
    - If user just said "no" or "incorrect", DO NOT call this tool yet
    - First ask which fields need updating using respond_about_account_opening()
    - Then collect the new values through conversation
    - Finally, call this tool with the updated values

    AUTOMATIC MERGING: You only need to provide the fields that changed!
    - The tool automatically merges your updates with the original client info
    - Fields set to None will be filled from ctx.deps.current_client_info
    - Example: If only address changed, provide WealthManagementClient with address="456 Oak St" and other fields as None

    Args:
        client_details: WealthManagementClient object with the UPDATED fields.
                       Unchanged fields can be None - they'll be automatically filled from the original client info.
